# BSc thesis project
This is a repo for the project I worked on for my BSc thesis. It is the source code used to program the device my thesis partner and I created. It is an embedded system device, utilizing an ATmega328P microcontroller, along with an IAM-20380 3-axis gyroscope and a H3LIS200DL 3-axis linear accelerometer and a Keyestudio HM-10 Bluetooth module. 
For communication between the embedded modules the I2C communication protocol was used, and the UART protocol for the bluetooth communications. The device was connected to an Android phone that run a custom app we also created for communicating with the device.
