# BSc thesis project
This is a repo for the project I worked on for my BSc thesis. It is the source code used to program the device my thesis partner and I created. It is an embedded system device, utilizing an ATmega328P microcontroller, along with an IAM-20380 3-axis gyroscope, a H3LIS200DL 3-axis linear accelerometer and a Keyestudio HM-10 Bluetooth module.  <br>
The I2C communication protocol was used for communication between the embedded modules, and the UART protocol for the bluetooth communications. The device was connected to an Android phone that run a custom app we also created for communicating with the device.
